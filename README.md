# HackerRank Puzzle Solutions

I like to spend sometime to solve [HackerRank Challenges](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges) ðŸ˜€

You can find my _humble_ solutions for the following questions;

## Mini-Max Sum

[HackerRank Mini-Max Sum Challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/mini-max-sum/problem)

Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

For example, `arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`. Our minimum sum is `1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16` and our maximum sum is `3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 24`. We would print `16 24`.

You can find my solution in the [minimaxsum](./minimaxsum/) folder.

## StairCase

[HackerRank StairCase Challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/staircase/problem)

Consider a staircase of size `n = 4`:

```javascript
   #
  ##
 ###
####
```

Observe that its base and height are both equal to `n`, and the image is drawn using # symbols and spaces. The last line is not preceded by any spaces.

Write a program that prints a staircase of size `n`.

You can find my solution in the [staircase](./staircase/) folder.
