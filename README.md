You can find my _humble_ solutions for the following questions;

## Mini-Max Sum

[HackerRank Mini-Max Sum Challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/mini-max-sum/problem)

Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

For example, `arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`. Our minimum sum is `1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16` and our maximum sum is `3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 24`. We would print `16 24`.

You can find my solution in the [minimaxsum](./minimaxsum/) folder.
